/* 
  GAME LOGIC:
  We have two players of the game. Each player rolls the dice by
  pressing a buttun (btnRoll). A player can decide to go for another
  roll after a previous roll, and for each roll players score gets in
  remented by the dice number (1 up to 6). But a play can decide to pre
  ss the hold button to preserve the current score he has, because all wi
  ll be lost if a next roll is equal to 1. 

  CHALLENGING MYSELF
  As the current state of the game, player 1 must start the game. There is no
  way player 2 can start ahead of player 1. You can modify this to give an opp
  ortunity to any of the players to start the game. 

  HINT: ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
      You should find a way to make the variable activePlayer dynamic.
